A collection of high-level R functions to make data manipulation a breeze. Relies heavily on the Hadleyverse packages.


Design
------

### Purpose
Planned functionality includes methods to:

- Locate certain common columns in tabular data, such as:
-- Names
-- IDs
- Enable character conversions of entire data structures for common non-ASCII characters such as e.g. `åäöüçß` and uppercase variants
- Visualise the anatomy of hierarchical data structures (i.e. lists of lists)
- Produce graphical summaries of tabluar and hierarchical data
- Find and remove "ugly" parts of tabular data, i.e. rows with many NAs, columns with missing data etc.
- Locate and visualise outliers
- Refactor character and factor variables (useful for managing multiple choice data)
